# Web Accessibility

## Manual analysis 
- Semantic Structure: Something that we did not use was a h1 header, we could have used one but, personally, we believe that there was no actual use of using a h1 header.
- 

## Automated analysis
- Contrasting text on navbar and submit buttons: One error we got right away was the navbar, when on a current page the text would be contrasting the bubble, we decided to change it to darker shade of the of the same color.

- Semantic structure: Once again, we got an error about not including a h1 header

## Changes made

## Gestalt Principles
- Proximity: When we use accessibilty, such as grouping form fields, it helps the user quickly understand and interact with the elements without much confusion

- Similarity: Having similar patterns (such as our navbar) can help users navigate easier.
