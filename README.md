# Web Accessibility

## Manual analysis 
- Semantic Structure: Something that we did not use was a h1 header

## Automated analysis
- Contrasting text on navbar and submit buttons: One error we got right away was the navbar, when on a current page the text would be contrasting the bubble, we decided to change it to darker shade of the of the same color.

- Semantic structure: Once again, we got an error about not including a h1 header

## Changes made
When building our website, we encountered accessibility issues, in design and functionality. For example, when working on the services page, we changed the elements from a table to a grid layout. We noticed that there was no more need for the "Scroll to Top" button for larger screens since there was no scroll bar. Eventually, when we got to making the page responsive for smaller screens we noticed that we should keep it for the smaller screens since scrolling back up takes a while. Additionally, we encountered many other issues like having consistent colors for backgrounds and text, and having descriptive alt text. In general, we discussed and brainstormed ideas on how we can resolve these accessibility issues.

## Gestalt Principles
- Proximity: When we use accessibility, such as grouping form fields, it helps the user quickly understand and interact with the elements without much confusion

- Similarity: Having similar patterns (such as our navbar) can help users navigate easier.

- Figure-Ground: This principles makes sure the visibility and readability are enhanced for visually impaired. Ensures that there is a appropriate color contrast which clearly distinguishes foreground content

- Continuity: Using proper heading hierarchies and navigation structures. Making this accessible means to allow for a smooth order which should help users to follow content naturally.

- Closure: Making this properly accessible should mean it guides the user through interaction on the site, such as forms, where you can provide visual cues for completion.
